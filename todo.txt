- [ ] Allow sound in video recording
- [ ] Figure out why countdown dies (doesn't return 0) @bug
- [ ] Why are most ffcast commands in set +e? Could it be related to countdown dying? @q
- [ ] Consider using ffmpeg + slop for recording, see: slop readme
- [ ] Why use slop when 'ffcast -s' exists? The selection looks better I guess... auto select window? Does that mean window is unnecessary? @q
- [ ] Figure out how copying videos work, if it's even possible...
- [ ] rofi window fills entire screen at first run (happened on manjaro on two separate computers) (could $LINES be the culprit?) @bug
- [ ] custom rofi theme?
- [ ] argparse optional keyword to argument (e.g. '--file' doens't *need* a keyword, it should auto-generate a name by default), or just use '-' ('--file -')
- [ ] Consistent variable naming (CASE / case / _case) @improvement
- [ ] Show info about how to stop recording when starting one
- [ ] Will geospec fail with '&& continue'?

- [ ] -t|--timeout for gif / mp4 recording (stop video after n seconds) @flag
- [ ] (p1) Instead of a 'stop' command, detect if the script is recording and stop the existing one (like sharex, so you don't need two binds)
- [ ] Document examples @docs
